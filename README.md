## Getting Started with Playwright for Klimato App

This repository contains automated tests for the [Klimato client repository](https://github.com/Klimato/client). These tests are written using Playwright, an end-to-end testing framework that supports both cross-browser and cross-platform testing.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/msamaae/client-test.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-playwright-test-repo
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

To configure the test environment and settings, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the project root directory.
2. Remove the `.example` extension from the file name, so it becomes `.env`.

Now, you have an `.env` file in the project root. Open this file and set the necessary environment variables to meet your specific testing needs.

### Writing Tests

You can find the test scripts in the tests directory. Feel free to modify or create new test files to suit your testing requirements.
